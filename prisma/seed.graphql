      shortDescription: "With a geodesic dome loft & a large deck in the trees, you'll feel like you're in a tree house in the woods. We are in a quiet yet convenient location. Shaded by Oak and Madrone trees and next to a Redwood grove, you can enjoy the outdoors from the deck. In the summer, it is cool and in the winter you might get to hear the creek running below."
      description: "The space\\n\\nWe have 10 acres next to land without fences so you will get to enjoy nature: just hang out on the deck, take a hike in the woods, watch the hummingbirds, pet the goats, go to the beach or gaze at the stars - as long as the moon isn't full. ; ) During the summer, if there isn't any nightly fog, we can see the Milky Way here.\\n\\nTo check our availability, click on the \"Request to Support\" link."
